- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an *unofficial* Wii U Client for mii-man/aurorachat and a backend for it which I call "Borealis".
- ðŸ‘¯ If you are willing to help or want to collaborate then feel free to do so! (You can contact me with the details below)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, but also have interest in C, C++, JavaScript and Python
- âš¡ Fun fact: The nickname *Funtum* is a result of people pronouncing my previous nickname wrong: *Phuntum*, and that nickname is the word "Phantom" but the letters **a** and **o** replaced with the letter **u**
- ðŸ“« My Discord Is "itsfuntum" and my Pretendo Network ID (PNID) is "Funtum"
